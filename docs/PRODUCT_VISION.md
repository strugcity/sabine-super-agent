## Vision Statement

**Sabine is the intelligent assistant that truly understands your life.**

We envision a world where managing family logistics, coordinating complex schedules, and accessing personalized assistance is as natural as texting a friend. Sabine will be the trusted, context-aware AI companion that works seamlessly across any device or communication channel, remembering what matters and proactively helping families stay organized and connected.

**In 5 years, Sabine will be the de facto standard for family coordination and personal assistance—the AI that knows you, your family, and your unique needs better than any other system.**

---

## Mission

Our mission is to **eliminate the cognitive overhead of modern family logistics** by building an AI assistant that:

1. **Remembers everything that matters** - Never forget important context, preferences, or commitments
2. **Works everywhere you are** - No apps to install, no specific devices required
3. **Understands your family dynamics** - Custody schedules, preferences, and complex relationships
4. **Takes action, not just answers** - Proactively manage tasks and coordinate logistics
5. **Respects your privacy** - Your data is yours, encrypted and secure

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### The Modern Family Coordination Crisis

Modern families face an unprecedented coordination burden:

- **51% of divorced parents** report missing or forgetting custody schedules
- **Average parent spends 8-12 hours/week** on logistical coordination
- **73% of families** use 5+ different apps/tools for scheduling, messaging, and task management
- **Context switching costs** 23 minutes per interruption to regain focus
- **Existing AI assistants** have no memory, no family context, and require specific devices

### Why Current Solutions Fail

**Smart Assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant):**
- ❌ No persistent memory between sessions
- ❌ Device-dependent (need specific hardware)
- ❌ No understanding of family dynamics
- ❌ Limited to simple commands, not complex coordination
- ❌ Privacy concerns with always-listening devices

**Calendar/Scheduling Apps:**
- ❌ Manual data entry required
- ❌ No intelligent assistance or proactive help
- ❌ Don't understand context or relationships
- ❌ Fragmented across multiple apps
- ❌ Require constant checking and updates

**Shared Custody Apps:**
- ❌ Both parents must adopt the same app
- ❌ Limited to scheduling, no broader assistance
- ❌ Often expensive ($10-20/month per parent)
- ❌ No AI intelligence or natural language interaction
- ❌ Another app to remember to check

**ChatGPT/Claude (Direct AI):**
- ❌ No memory of your life or preferences
- ❌ Can't take action (send emails, create events)
- ❌ Not accessible via SMS or voice
- ❌ Requires starting from scratch each time
- ❌ No integration with your tools
