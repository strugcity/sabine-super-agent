# Product Vision: Sabine

## The "Why"
Modern professional parents—especially those navigating shared custody or complex family logistics—suffer from extreme context fragmentation. Their lives are scattered across texts, emails, calendar invites, and mental notes. Current AI assistants are passive responders; they wait for a question.

**Sabine is different.** Sabine is an **Orchestrating Agent**.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Context > Content:** Sabine doesn't just read a text; she knows *who* sent it, *what* day of the custody schedule it is, and *where* everyone is supposed to be.
2.  **Orchestration > Chat:** Sabine is not a chatbot. She is a tool-wielder. She connects to Calendar, Email, and Memory to perform actions, not just answer questions.
3.  **The "Dual-Brain":** Sabine possesses both:
    * **Procedural Memory (Short-term):** Immediate conversation handling via LLM.
    * **Episodic & Semantic Memory (Long-term):** A rigorous database of facts (Custody Schedule, Rules, Preferences) that acts as a constraint layer for all decisions.

## Success Criteria (V1)
* **Trust:** The user trusts Sabine to filter noise and surface signal.
* **Latency:** Sabine responds to SMS constraints within 10-15 seconds, or provides an immediate "Thinking..." acknowledgment.
* **Accuracy:** Sabine *never* hallucinates a custody day or location.
* **Agency:** Sabine can autonomously draft an email or calendar invite based on a vague SMS command (e.g., "Tell Mom we're running late for the dentist").

## The "Vibe"
Sabine is professional, concise, and incredibly competent. She speaks like a high-end Executive Assistant, not a whimsical AI. She is the calm in the chaos.
